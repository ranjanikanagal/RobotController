Robot Program
 Simple Robot Control:

Things Implemented:

-Rock - A cell where the robot cannot move 
-Hole- Connecting to a different cell in the grid

Assumption 

Each time the robot can move only one cell.
Grid size is N=10
Row,Col num is the path which the robot has traversed. 
0,0 Start position of the Robot
9.9 is the End position and game ends when robot reaches there. 
Black color cell represents a Rock.
Cyan color cell represents a Hole. 
Static position of the obstacles.


Things Not implemented:
Spinner :- Couldnt implement 90 Degree rotation. 
Backward Traversal
The predefined position of the object like rock and hole . 
Dynamic program to accomodate any grid size. 

Extra credit:
Grid Size predefined can be changed so that we can accomodate any grid.
Implement radndom logic to define obstacles rather than staticly assigning it.
